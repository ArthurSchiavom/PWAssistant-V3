            Hello!

            I was initially released in November 2017 with the purpose of helping administrate and serve the members of **PWI Kingdom**.
            PWI Kingdom is a Discord server for PWI players to discuss PWI stuff, just hang around, meet people, get help, stay informed, etc.
            I also provide this server with more commands and features!

            We currently have over 300 members from all servers online every day!
            **__If you wish to join, we'll be glad to welcome you!__**
